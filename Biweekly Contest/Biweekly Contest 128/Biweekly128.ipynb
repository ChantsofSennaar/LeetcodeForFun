    "Solution: Most of problems related to subarray can be solved by sliding window. The key to this problem is how to maintain the status of the sliding window, here is how to undo the & operation. We should always try to perform the undo operation under constant(or log) time complexity. Here since it's a bid manipulation, it's obvious that we should use a bit frequency table. For each bit, we can maintain a set which records the index of the number in nums list which has 1 on that bit."
